# World Wide Live
>Connect live from anywhere on Earth! ^_^

The webapp can be accessed from this URL: https://world-wide-live-9f9de.web.app/

## App description
The user will make an account or sign in before accessing the app. Once signed in the user can search for locations like cities, postal codes or addresses. The user will then be presented with a list of Youtube livestreams that are availible close to that location. The list includes thumbnails, titles, description and channel name. When the user clicks on a thumbnail or title they will be sent to Youtube where they can watch the stream. Searches that the user has made are stored in firebase and the top 3 searches can be viewed in the app.

## What could be done given more time (or continued upon in the future)
- Styling, responsive layout, custom logo
- Embedded Youtube player (or link to Youtube if API cost is too high)
- Present more information about the stream
- Search features like radius and autocompletion
- Filter options like views, etc...
- An interactive map with markers for the live streams
- A random location option
